ruby-mergesort
==============

Merge sort in Ruby.  

Although the algorithm is well-known, the code here will evolve via TDD.

## TODO

  * Undo the previous commit and take a smaller step, using `#sort` instead of `#merge`
  * Continue to TDD the remainder of the algorithm
  * Simulate "large" input, i.e. 4GB
